      <h3>HTTP/1.1: endurance and scale</h3>
      <p>HTTP/1.1, standardized in 1997, remained the dominant protocol for nearly two decades. It introduced persistent connections, caching policies, and other optimizations that made the web reliably scalable. Its longevity was due to balancing simplicity and capability, allowing different browsers and servers to interoperate smoothly.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>HTTP/2: multiplexing and efficiency</h3>
      <p>Standardized in 2015, HTTP/2 addressed the performance challenges of heavier webpages by introducing multiplexing and binary framing. Multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses to share a single connection without causing head-of-line blocking. The result: faster page loads and better use of the underlying network without reducing content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>HTTP/3 and QUIC</h3>
      <p>HTTP/3 is built on QUIC, a transport protocol developed by Google that uses UDP instead of TCP. QUIC reduces connection setup latency and improves resilience against packet loss, which is especially important for mobile and global traffic. By the early 2020s, major browsers began adopting HTTP/3, reflecting the web's need for speed and robustness.</p>
