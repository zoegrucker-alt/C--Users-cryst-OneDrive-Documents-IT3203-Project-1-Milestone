    <h2>HTTP/2 and HTTP/3</h2>
    <p>
      With the web’s growth, speed and efficiency became crucial. HTTP/2 (2015) brought multiplexing and binary framing,
      making websites load faster and more efficiently. HTTP/3, built on QUIC, uses UDP to reduce delay and packet loss,
      ensuring smoother communication across devices.

    <h3>The Future of HTTP</h3>
    <p>
      The next iterations of HTTP may focus on deeper encryption, privacy, and integration with IoT and AI systems. 
      As technology evolves, HTTP continues to adapt—remaining the invisible backbone of our connected world.
