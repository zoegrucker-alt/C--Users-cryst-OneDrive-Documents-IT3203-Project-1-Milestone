      <h3>HTTP/1.1: Endurance and Scale</h3>
      <p>Standardized in 1997, HTTP/1.1 became the backbone of the web for nearly two decades. Persistent connections, caching policies, and chunked transfer encoding enabled efficient resource delivery. Its balance of simplicity and capability allowed browsers and servers worldwide to interoperate reliably.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>HTTP/2: Multiplexing and Efficiency</h3>
      <p>Introduced in 2015, HTTP/2 tackled performance bottlenecks caused by modern, media-heavy websites. Multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses to share one connection without head-of-line blocking. Binary framing reduced overhead, resulting in faster page loads and smoother user experiences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>HTTP/3 and QUIC</h3>
      <p>HTTP/3 leverages QUIC, a transport protocol built on UDP, to reduce latency and improve resilience against packet loss. This is crucial for mobile networks and global traffic. By the early 2020s, major browsers adopted HTTP/3, marking a shift toward speed, reliability, and improved web performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Modern Practices</h3>
      <p>Developers today leverage HTTPS by default, implement caching strategies, and use content delivery networks (CDNs) to optimize performance. Modern web frameworks and APIs rely heavily on these protocols for secure and efficient data delivery, highlighting HTTP's evolving role in supporting fast, safe, and scalable applications.</p>
