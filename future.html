      <h3>HTTPS and security</h3>
      <p>HTTPS—HTTP layered over TLS—has turned encryption into a baseline expectation for web traffic. TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 provide strong encryption and faster handshakes, keeping communications private and secure. Modern browsers now actively warn users when a site is not encrypted, reflecting the web’s shift toward "HTTPS everywhere." As threats evolve, future protocols will likely integrate stronger privacy measures and default protections, making secure communication automatic rather than optional.</p>
      <p>Statistics show that over 95% of global web traffic is now encrypted, a dramatic increase from just a decade ago. With cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated, embedding security directly into HTTP’s future iterations will be crucial for maintaining user trust.</p>

      <h3>IoT, 5G, and new demands</h3>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding, with billions of devices—from smart home sensors to industrial machinery—communicating over HTTP. The rise of 5G networks and edge computing enables faster and lower-latency data transfer, but also introduces challenges: devices with limited processing power or intermittent connectivity need lightweight, efficient protocols to stay reliable.</p>
      <p>Future HTTP versions will need to support these scenarios, providing optimized communication for high-frequency sensor data, immersive VR, and AI-driven applications. Protocol adaptations may include more intelligent caching, adaptive bandwidth usage, and built-in error correction to accommodate diverse device capabilities and network conditions.</p>

      <h3>Beyond HTTP/3</h3>
      <p>HTTP/3 and the QUIC transport protocol represent a major shift in web communication, emphasizing speed and reliability. Looking ahead, researchers and engineers are exploring even more advanced protocols to reduce latency, improve congestion handling, and enhance global interoperability. Experiments include HTTP over satellite networks, improved connection migration for mobile users, and tighter integration with decentralized systems.</p>
      <p>Privacy will remain a central focus, with initiatives like end-to-end encryption, DNS over HTTPS, and privacy-preserving analytics becoming increasingly important. The future of HTTP promises a web that is not only faster and more reliable, but also more secure and adaptive to the demands of our connected, data-driven world.</p>
