      <h3>HTTPS and security</h3>
      <p>HTTPS—HTTP layered over TLS—has turned encryption into a baseline expectation for web traffic. TLS helps keep communications private and secure, and the web has moved steadily toward "HTTPS everywhere." As threats evolve, future protocol changes may bake in stronger privacy features and default protections.</p>

      <h3>IoT, 5G, and new demands</h3>
      <p>As the Internet of Things grows, billions of devices will rely on efficient, lightweight ways to communicate. With 5G and edge computing, HTTP will carry more immediate loads (real-time data, immersive VR, AI-driven apps). Protocols will need to adapt to devices with limited resources and new connectivity patterns.</p>

      <h3>Beyond HTTP/3</h3>
      <p>Research and discussion continue about what comes next: deeper integration with privacy systems, adaptive congestion controls, and possible interoperability with decentralized networks. HTTP's future will likely emphasize both speed and trustworthiness as the web becomes more central to daily life.</p>
