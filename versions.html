    <h2>HTTP/1.0 and 1.1</h2>
    <p>
      By 1996, HTTP/1.0 introduced headers and status codes, giving machines a richer vocabulary.
      Soon after, HTTP/1.1 followed in 1997 — providing persistent connections, caching,
      and efficiency that allowed the web to scale globally.
    </p>

    <h2>HTTP/2 and 3</h2>
    <p>
      Standardized in 2015, HTTP/2 brought multiplexing and binary framing, reducing delays
      and speeding up content delivery. HTTP/3, built on Google’s QUIC protocol, shifted
      to UDP to improve connection stability and reduce latency.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      The future of HTTP promises even greater speed, privacy, and adaptability. From the
      Internet of Things to blockchain and 5G, HTTP will continue to evolve — remaining
      the invisible foundation of our connected world.
