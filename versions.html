      <h2>HTTP/1.0 — The First Web Standard (1996)</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP/1.0 introduced the first standardized request and response formats, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)</li>
        <li>Headers to describe content type, length, and caching</li>
        <li>Basic communication between browsers and servers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each request required a separate connection, which slowed websites as the internet grew.
      </p>

      <h2>HTTP/1.1 — Improved Performance (1997)</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP/1.1 brought major improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent connections for multiple resources per session</li>
        <li>Better caching mechanisms to reduce repeated downloads</li>
        <li>Host headers to allow multiple websites on one server</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These updates made modern websites possible and improved loading speed significantly.

    <section class="info-section">
      <h2>HTTP/2 — Multiplexing and Speed (2015)</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP/2 addressed growing web complexity with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiplexing to send multiple files simultaneously over one connection</li>
        <li>Binary framing for faster and more efficient communication</li>
        <li>Header compression to reduce bandwidth</li>
        <li>Server push to proactively send resources to the browser</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These improvements reduced page load times and allowed richer, interactive websites.
      </p>

    <section class="info-section">
      <h2>HTTP/3 — Built on QUIC (2022+)</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP/3 replaces TCP with QUIC (built on UDP), improving:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster recovery from lost packets</li>
        <li>Better performance on mobile and unreliable networks</li>
        <li>Reduced latency with built-in encryption</li>
        <li>More stable connections when switching networks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Major platforms, including Google, YouTube, and Cloudflare, are already using HTTP/3.
      </p>

    <section class="info-section">
      <h2>The Future of HTTP</h2>
      <p>
        The evolution of HTTP continues to focus on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhanced privacy and security by default</li>
        <li>Optimizations for IoT and low-bandwidth devices</li>
        <li>Better support for high-speed networks like 5G</li>
        <li>Potential integration with decentralized technologies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        HTTP will remain the backbone of our connected world, powering faster, safer, and more
        reliable web experiences.
