      <h3>From Concept to First Requests</h3>
      <p>
        In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee at CERN envisioned a network of linked documents, but for
        this vision to work, computers needed a universal language. Alongside collaborators
        like Robert Cailliau, he developed the first web server and browser, releasing HTTP/0.9
        in 1991. This initial version was minimal—supporting only a single GET request—but
        it established the foundation for a living, networked web that could expand far
        beyond static files.

      <h3>Key Contributors</h3>
      <p>
        Robert Cailliau played a critical role by promoting the project and organizing resources,
        helping Berners-Lee’s vision gain traction. Henrik Frystyk Nielsen contributed to HTTP
        specifications and later worked within the W3C, ensuring interoperability and web standards.
        Roy Fielding’s architectural insights, including the REST paradigm, influenced the way
        the web handled communication and scalability. Together, these pioneers exemplify
        the collaborative effort behind HTTP’s creation.

      <h3>Early Features and Expansion</h3>
      <p>
        HTTP quickly evolved to support the growing web. HTTP/1.0, released in 1996, added headers
        and status codes, allowing browsers and servers to exchange richer information.
        By 1997, HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and caching,
        enabling faster and more reliable communication. These changes laid the groundwork
        for large-scale, cross-platform web functionality.

      <h3>HTTP in Everyday Life</h3>
      <p>
        While HTTP often operates invisibly in our daily digital interactions, its impact is profound.
        From sending emails to streaming videos, HTTP ensures seamless communication across devices.
        Early web engineers created a protocol that balanced simplicity with the ability to scale
        globally, a principle that continues to guide its evolution.
