      <h3>From concept to first requests</h3>
      <p>When Tim Berners-Lee worked at CERN in 1989 he imagined a web of linked documents. To make that vision reality, computers needed a common language. Berners-Lee and collaborators like Robert Cailliau built the first web server and browser; the earliest HTTP (HTTP/0.9) was released in 1991 and was intentionally minimal — it supported a single GET request and nothing more. That minimal beginning contained the seed of what the web could become: living, networked documents rather than files on disks.</p>

      <h3>Key contributors</h3>
      <p>Robert Cailliau promoted the web project and provided essential organizational support; Henrik Frystyk Nielsen later contributed to HTTP specifications and the W3C era of standards. Roy Fielding’s later work established architectural ideas (like REST) that influenced web design and protocol thinking. These early figures show that HTTP emerged from collaboration and consensus, not solitary invention.</p>

      <h3>Early features and expansion</h3>
      <p>HTTP/0.9’s simplicity gave way to richer versions as the web expanded. By 1996, HTTP/1.0 introduced headers and status codes; in 1997 HTTP/1.1 standardized persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and caching. Those changes gave browsers and servers more expressive power and made the web more efficient and robust.</p>
